## {{request.user.userrname}} tells the username of the currently logged-in user. If the user is logged in, 
it will give its username; if itâ€™s not logged in, it will print nothing. The chat page looks like this now, 
because there is no current logged-in user and {{request.user.username}} prints out nothing.
